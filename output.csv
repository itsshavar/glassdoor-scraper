Yet, the industry standard for producing these high-quality training datasets is to use human annotators who usually produce these datasets by hand. The main reason why this is the industry standard is that usually with an expert annotator who has the right domain knowledge the accuracy level for these training datasets is usually very high (99% or above) which is essential to train ML algorithms effectively. Otherwise, you could crowdsource the data to a crowdsourcing platform but then the accuracy level usually isn’t very high with this method. However, the two major downsides with these approaches are that the turnaround time for the datasets is usually very high. It could take weeks or months depending on the volume of the data. Moreover, because it’s done manually the cost is usually exorbitantly high.In order to solve this huge data bottleneck that the ML pipeline faces we are building a program that will programmatically generate training datasets. The main challenge will be to keep the accuracy level at 99% or more but the turnaround time will come down significantly. We are talking about hours or even minutes over time and because it’s done programmatically the cost will be exorbitantly low.This is a hard problem to solve, hence why there isn’t any go-to solution for this in the market yet. This is why I am looking for capable ML Engineers who will join our team to contribute towards solving this pressing issue that will help accelerate the growth of ML and AI applications in various industries and in consumer tech products throughout India.Here are the specifications required for the job: You should have demonstrated interest and passion in ML/DL/AI in college through projects, internships, and/or research work. Work experience with ML and AI is also great. You should be well-versed in PyTorch and Python and other DL languages and applications. You should preferably be a hard-core ML/DL/AI person but even someone with knowledge of generative models, discriminative models, and other ML models is welcome to apply. You should be someone with the drive to complete a complicated task really well in 1/3 the time that most competent people deem possible and should have the drive to do important work that will put India on the map with ML and AI.You will be working with some of the smartest people from IITs and other leading tech institutions to devise a solution to this hard problem.If you want to be a part of this tectonic shift in AI, send in your application and I look forward to reviewing it.Expected Start Date: 15/2/2021Job Type: Full-timeSalary: ₹21,121.00 - ₹89,703.00 per monthBenefits:Health insuranceSchedule:Monday to FridaySupplemental Pay:Yearly bonusExperience:Machine Learning: 1 year (Preferred)work: 1 year (Preferred)total work: 1 year (Preferred)Education:Bachelor's (Required)
